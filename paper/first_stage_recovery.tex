\section{Description of Recovery Strategies}
Although only two vehicles with recoverable stages have been operated, a wide variety of first stage recovery strategies have been proposed. This section seeks to develop a systematic classification of recovery strategies, which will be useful in comparing their relative merits.

First stage recovery strategies can be characterized by three high-level choices:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{Portion of stage recovered} - Some strategies recover the entire first stage, while others propose to only recover a portion containing the higher-value components (e.g. main engines).
	\item \textit{Deceleration and maneuvering method} - The first stage must have some means to control and slow its re-entry trajectory. The deceleration and maneuvering methods can be grouped into three categories: propulsive designs which use the main engines to maneuver and land vertically; winged designs which use aerodynamic surfaces to maneuver and land horizontally; and design which decelerate using parachutes. Note that these are not absolute distinctions: current propulsive-landing designs use small aerodynamic control surfaces, and some proposed winged designs have auxiliary propulsion to increase their range.
	\item \textit{Recovery location} - The stage may be recovered downrange, or may fly itself back for recovery at the launch site. Most downrange recovery strategies land on a boat or in the ocean, although some call for the recovered components to be caught by an aircraft in midair \cite{Ragab2015}.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:recov_strat_diagram} illustrates the concept of operations for various strategies formed from the above choices. Strategies which have been carried out or proposed are listed in Table \ref{tab:vehicles}, and along the bottom of Figure \ref{fig:recov_strat_diagram}.

Despite their wide variety, all these strategies face the same fundamental tradeoff between performance and cost. On the performance side, all recovery strategies require the first stage to carry extra mass during ascent, reducing the payload which can be lifted to orbit. However, recovering and reusing some of the first stage has the potential to reduce launch costs by eliminating the need to re-build expensive hardware\footnote{A reduction in cost is by no means guaranteed. As the Space Shuttle program demonstrated, excessive refurbishment and operations costs can make a reusable system more expensive than expendable alternatives.}. We should expect that recovery strategies will differ in their performance penalty and potential for cost reduction. The fundamental question is which, if any, of the recovery strategies can offer a small enough payload reduction and a large enough cost reduction to be worthwhile?

To make this question more concrete, this paper defines two figures of merit for recovery strategies: the payload factor $r_p$ and the cost factor $r_c$. These factors compare the payload capacity and cost of a vehicle with a reusable first stage to an equivalent\footnote{The `equivalent' expendable vehicle uses the same propulsion and structural technologies, and has the same gross liftoff mass $m_{0,1}$} vehicle with an expendable first stage. The payload factor is the payload capacity of the partially reusable vehicle divided by the payload capacity of the equivalent expendable vehicle. The cost factor is the average flight cost of the reusable first stage divided by the average flight cost of an expendable first stage.

When comparing recovery strategies, we can largely neglect their internal complexities and consider each strategy to be represented by a tuple $\mathcal{R}: \{r_p, r_c\}$. We seek recovery strategies with high payload factor ($r_p \rightarrow 1$) and low cost factor ($r_c \rightarrow 0$).

The following two sections attempt to provide quantitative, first-principles tools to estimate $r_p$ and $r_c$. The payload factor can be easily estimated with a fair degree of accuacy, but cost modeling involves more guesswork. The TODO nth section examines the trade-offs between different strategies. Because the willingness of a launch provider to trade payload for cost is uncertain, this comparison is framed to yield a set of recovery strategies which is Pareto-optimal in $(r_p, r_c)$.




\section{Performance Model}
TODO
This section provides a general, first-principles framework for estimating the payload reduction factor $r_p$ of a recovery strategy. The fundamental cause of payload reduction is that a recoverable stage must carry extra mass, as recovery hardware or propellant reserved for recovery maneuvers. This extra mass reduces the fraction of the stage's mass which is expelled during ascent. To still deliver the required $\Delta v$ to the payload, the payload mass fraction must then be reduced.

\subsection{Payload factor and first stage unavailable mass}
This subsection establishes a relationship between the payload factor $r_p$ and the extra mass carried on the first stage for recovery.
The reduction in payload can be seen from the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. For a two-stage, sequentially stage rocket, the equation is \cite{Wiesel2010}:

\begin{equation}
\Delta v_* =  \sum_{i=1}^{2} - c_i \ln\left( \epsilon_i + (1 - \epsilon_i) \pi_i \right)
\end{equation} 

$\Delta v_*$ is the `mission $\Delta v$' required to lift the payload to its desired orbit. $c_i$ is the effective exhaust velocity ($c = I_{sp} g_0$) of stage $i$, averaged over the ambient pressures at which the stage operates. The log-mass term is written in terms of the dimensionless parameters $\epsilon_i$ and $\pi_i$. $\epsilon_i$ is the inert mass fraction of stage $i$; it depends only on the design of the stage.

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_i = \frac{m_{s,i}}{m_{s,i} + m_{p,i}}
\end{equation}

$\pi_i$ is the mass of the stage's payload (including all higher stages) divided by the gross mass at stage ignition:

\begin{equation}
\pi_1 = \frac{m_{0,2}}{m_{0,1}}, \quad \pi_2 = \frac{m_*}{m_{0,2}}
\end{equation}

The overall payload ratio of the launch vehicle, $\pi_*$ is the product of the stage payload ratios:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pi_star}
\pi_* = \frac{m_*}{m_{0,1}} = \pi_1 \pi_2
\end{equation} 

Modifying the rocket for first stage recovery effectively increases the inert mass fraction of the first stage to some new value $\epsilon_1'$. I will call $\epsilon_1'$ the `unavailable mass fraction', as it is the fraction of the first stage's mass which is unavailable for expulsion to propel the ascent. It includes the mass of the first stage structure ($m_{s,1}$) , the mass of recovery hardware ($m_{rh,1}$), and the mass of propellant reserved for recovery maneuvers ($m_{pr,1}$). The unavailable mass fraction can also be thought of as the first stage mass at stage separation divided by the first stage mass at liftoff.

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_1' = \frac{m_{s,1} + m_{rh,1} + m_{pr,1}}{m_{s,1} + m_{rh,1} + m_{p,1}}
\end{equation}

Then, the rocket equation for ascent is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:recov_rocket}
\Delta v_* =  - c_1 \ln\left( \epsilon_1' + (1 - \epsilon_1') \pi_1 \right) - c_2 \ln\left( \epsilon_2 + (1 - \epsilon_2) \pi_2 \right)
\end{equation}

Our goal is to use Equation \ref{eq:recov_rocket} to determine how changes to $\epsilon_1'$ affect $\pi_*$. To do this, we need to introduce a few additional constraints. First, we assume that the stage 2 / stage 1 mass ratio has a some value $y$.

\begin{equation}
y = \frac{m_{s,2} + m_{p,2}}{m_{s,1} + m_{rh,1} + m_{p,1}}
\end{equation}

It can be shown that

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ypi}
\pi_2 = (y + 1) - \frac{y}{\pi_1}
\end{equation}

Second, we define a `technology choice', $\mathcal{T}$, which influences the mass ratios and exhaust velocities. This choice encompasses technological factors such as the propellant (e.g. \ce{O2(l)}/kerosene vs. \ce{O2(l)}/\ce{H2(l)}), the tank construction technology (e.g. aluminum alloy vs. composite), and the engine cycle (e.g. gas generator vs. staged combustion). For the purposes of this model, the technology choice is fully described by the tuple $\mathcal{T} : \{ c_1, c_2, E_1, E_2 \}$, where $E$ is the technological lower limit on the structural mass fraction of an expendable stage. For expendable stages, $\epsilon_i = E_i$. For recoverable stages, $\epsilon_1' > E_1$.

If we know $\Delta v_*$ (set by the mission), the technology choice $\mathcal{T}$, and the stage mass ratio $y$, we can find $\pi_*(\epsilon_1')$ from Equations \ref{eq:pi_star}, \ref{eq:recov_rocket}, and \ref{eq:ypi}. Then, we can compare the payload capacity of the recoverable rocket to that of an equivalent expendable rocket to find the payload factor $r_p$. First, we will make our definition of `equivalent expendable rocket' more rigorous: the `equivalent' rocket uses the same technology choice, the same stage mass ratio, and has the same gross liftoff mass. We also assume that the mission $\Delta v_*$ is the same for both rockets \footnote{We might expect this assumption to be incorrect if the recovery strategy changes the $\Delta v$ losses during ascent (e.g. increased drag due to wings). However, an analysis by DRL finds that ``The impact of the different RLV-types [reusable launch vehicle] on the ascent flight profile is found small and, similar to the ELV [expendable launch vehicle] ascent flight performance losses, these are more dependent on the particular configuration with its T/W [thrust to weight] ratio than on the landing and return modes.'' \cite{Stappert2017}.}

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{T}^{\mathrm{expend}} = \mathcal{T}^{\mathrm{recov}}, \quad y^{\mathrm{expend}} = y^{\mathrm{recov}}, \quad m_{0,1}^{\mathrm{expend}} = m_{0,1}^{\mathrm{recov}}, \quad \Delta v_*^{\mathrm{expend}} = \Delta v_*^{\mathrm{recov}}
\end{equation}

Finally, the payload factor is

\begin{equation}
r_p = \frac{m_*^{\mathrm{recov}}}{m_*^{\mathrm{expend}}} = \frac{\pi_*^{\mathrm{recov}}}{\pi_*^{\mathrm{expend}}}
\end{equation}

The relation of $r_p$ to $\epsilon_1'$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:payload} for two typical launch missions (Low Earth Orbit $\Delta v_* = \SI{9.5}{\kilo\meter\per\second}$ and Geostationary Transfer Orbit $\Delta v_* = \SI{12.0}{\kilo\meter\per\second}$). As expected, the payload capacity declines with increasing first stage unavailable mass. Also, note that the decline is more severe for higher $\Delta v_*$ missions. Thus, a particular recovery strategy (with some $\epsilon_1'$) will have a smaller payload factor for GTO missions than for LEO missions ($r_p^{\mathrm{LEO}} > r_p^\mathrm{GTO}$). Higher $\Delta v_*$ missions put a bigger penalty on first stage recovery.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Determining the unavailable mass from recovery hardware and maneuvers}
This subsection provides techniques for estimating the unavailable mass fraction $\epsilon_1'$ from the hardware and maneuvers needed to recover the stage. First, consider the effects of added recovery hardware. Let $m_{s,1}$ be the minimum feasible mass of an expendable first stage which carries the first stage propellant load $m_{p,1}$. By definition,

\begin{equation}
m_{s,1} = m_{p,1} \frac{E_1}{1 - E_1}
\end{equation}

where $E_1$ is the minimum feasible inert mass fraction for the given technology choice $\mathcal{T}$. To enable recovery, this stage must have some hardware added to it, with mass $m_{rh,1}$. This includes, for example, the mass of wings, control surfaces, heat shields and landing gear added to the stage. It also includes any increase in mass (e.g. of the structure or engines) incurred by design requirements for re-usability or recovery loads. Define $\chi_r$ as the ratio of this additional mass to the minimum feasible mass of an expendable stage.

\begin{equation}
\chi_r = \frac{m_{rh,1}}{m_{s,1}}
\end{equation}

Then, the structural mass fraction of the reusable first stage will be

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_1 = \frac{\chi_r + 1}{\left(\frac{1 - E_1}{E_1} \right) + \chi_r + 1}
\end{equation}

For recovery strategies using rocket propulsion, the first stage must also carry some mass of propellant $m_{pr,1}$ for recovery maneuvers. The rocket equation for the recovery maneuver is

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:recov_rocket_eqn}
\frac{m_1^{\mathrm{separation}}}{m_1^{\mathrm{touchdown}}} = \frac{m_{s,1} + m_{rh,1} + m_{pr,1}}{m_{s,1} + m_{rh,1}} = \exp\left( \frac{\Delta v_r}{c_1} \right)
\end{equation}

where $\Delta v_r$ is the $\Delta v$ of the recovery maneuver. Note this equation assumes that the full stage is recovered. However this is a minor limitation as no partial recovery strategies have been proposed using rocket propulsion. Rearranging terms, we find that

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eps_chi_dv}
\epsilon_1' = \epsilon_1 \exp\left( \frac{\Delta v_r}{c_1} \right) = \left( \frac{\chi_r + 1}{\left(\frac{1 - E_1}{E_1} \right) + \chi_r + 1} \right) \exp\left( \frac{\Delta v_r}{c_1} \right)
\end{equation}

This provides a fundamental relation between the design of a stage ($\chi_r$), its recovery trajectory ($\Delta v_r$), and its unavailable mass fraction.

We now have the tools to estimate the payload factor $r_p$ for almost any recovery strategy. First, we can make reasonable estimates of $\chi_r$ and $\Delta v_r$ from physical first principles and analogies to similar systems. Then, we can use Equation \ref{eq:eps_chi_dv} to find $\epsilon_1'$, and the analysis of the preceding section to find $r_p$ from $\epsilon_1'$. The following subsection will perform this estimation for example recovery strategies.

We should first observe some general properties of Equation \ref{eq:eps_chi_dv}. Figure \ref{fig:unavail_mass} shows contours of $\epsilon_1'$ vs. $(\chi_r, \Delta v_r)$. As should be expected, the unavailable mass increases with both recovery hardware mass and recovery $\Delta v$. Note that any recovery strategies with the same $\epsilon_1'$ will have the same payload factor, even if they have different $(\chi_r, \Delta v_r)$. Under the technology assumptions of Figure \ref{fig:unavail_mass}, a winged recovery strategy with $(\chi_r=0.35, \Delta v_r=0)$ and a propulsive landing strategy with $(\chi_r=0.05, \Delta v_r=\SI{640}{\meter\per\second})$ lie on the same $\epsilon_1'$ contour, and would thus yield the same reduction in payload capacity.

\begin{figure}[hbt!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../unavail_mass}
	\label{fig:unavail_mass}
	\caption{Impact of recovery hardware mass $\chi_r$ and recovery $\Delta v$ on the first stage unavailable mass ratio $\epsilon_1'$. The technology choice values are typical for \ce{O2(l)}/kerosene and aluminum tanks.}
\end{figure}

Within a vehicle program designers may face small trade-offs between $\chi_r$ and $\Delta v_r$, i.e. when some adding some hardware to the vehicle could enable modifications to the return maneuver. For example, consider a propulsive landing vehicle which must make an entry deceleration maneuver to survive reentry. Suppose that by adding some heat shields to the vehicle it could be made to survive faster entry, and the required entry maneuver $\Delta v$ could be reduced. Is the additional mass worth the reduction in $\Delta v_r$? These questions can be addressed by computing the trade-off ratio for $\Delta v_r$ versus $\chi_r$ at constant $\epsilon_1'$:

\begin{equation}
\left. \pdv{\Delta v_r}{\chi_r} \right|_{\epsilon_1'} = - c_1 \frac{1 - E_1}{(\chi_r + 1)(E_1 \chi_r + 1)}
\end{equation}

For small $\chi_r$ this is approximately $c_1 (E_1 - 1)$. For a typical \ce{O2(l)}/kerosene stage, a design change which increases the dry mass by 1\% will need to reduce the recovery $\Delta v$ by \SI{26}{\meter\per\second} or more for the change to increase payload capacity (i.e. decrease $\epsilon_1'$).


\subsection{Performance estimates for some recovery strategies}
TODO

\subsubsection{Propulsive landing}
TODO
Up to three components: "rocket-back" (optional), "entry" (optional), and landing (required)

First, we will estimate the landing burn $\Delta v_{\mathrm{land}}$. When entering the atmosphere at a steep angle, a low density object such as an almost-empty stage will soon reach a quasi-equilibrium state, falling at its terminal velocity \cite{Wiesel2010}. The landing burn must cancel whatever terminal velocity $v_t$ the stage has when the landing burn begins. The landing burn will also incur some gravity loss. If the landing burn is performed vertically at a constant acceleration $a$, the gravity loss will be $v_t g_0 / a$.

\begin{equation}
\Delta v_{\mathrm{land}} = v_t + \Delta v_{g} = v_t + t_b g_0 = v_t(1 + \frac{g_0}{a})
\end{equation}

The terminal velocity is given by \cite{Wiesel2010}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:terminal_velocity}
v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2 m_{\mathrm{ign}} g_0}{C_D(v_t) A \rho_{0}}} \exp\left( \frac{H_\mathrm{ign}}{2H} \right)
\end{equation}

where $m_{\mathrm{ign}}$ is the stage mass at landing burn ignition, $C_D$ is the stage's drag coefficient, $A$ is its frontal area, $\rho_0, H_0$ are the base density and scale height of the atmosphere, and $H_\mathrm{ign}$ is the altitude at landing burn ignition. Unfortunately, $v_t$ may be transonic, so $C_D$ varies significantly with $v_t$. Also, $H_\mathrm{ign} = v_t^2 / (2 a)$.  Thus, Equation \ref{eq:terminal_velocity} must be solved iteratively.

We can make a first guess at $v_t$ using an empirical $C_D(M)$ relation for blunt cylinders from \cite{Hoerner1965}. The resulting terminal velocity is plotted against the stage mass to frontal area ratio in Figure \ref{fig:landing_dv}. The $m_{\mathrm{ign}}/A$ ratio should increase with vehicle size due to cube/square effect. It will likely be \SIrange{1500}{4000}{\kilogram\per\meter\square} for EELV-class stages (TODO data from CBC, CCB and F9 wikipedia pages), and \SIrange{400}{800}{\kilogram\per\meter\square} for small satellite launchers.

Recovery designers have several tools to reduce $\Delta v_{\mathrm{land}}$. High acceleration is favorable for landing burns because it (1) reduces gravity losses and (2) allows the burn to begin deeper in the atmosphere, where the terminal velocity is lower. The terminal velocity can also be decreased by adding deployable drag devices, or by `flying' the stage at a nonzero angle of attack.

Small vehicles have significantly lower landing $\Delta v$ because of their smaller mass/area ratio, however this also causes higher drag losses during ascent.

\begin{figure}[hbt!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../landing_dv}
	\label{fig:landing_dv}
	\caption{Variation of landing $\Delta v$ with stage mass / area ratio and landing burn acceleration. TODO draw \& label EELV-class and small sat ranges}
\end{figure}


The rocket-back and entry maneuver $\Delta v$s both depend on the magnitude of velocity at stage separation. This will be

\begin{equation}
v_{ss} = - c_1 \ln\left( \epsilon_1' + (1 - \epsilon_1') \pi_1 \right) - \Delta v_{1,loss}
\end{equation}

where $\Delta v_{1,loss}$ is the gravity and drag losses suffered during ascent up to stage separation (typically \SIrange{300}{1000}{\meter\per\second}). Notice that $v_{ss}$ depends on $\epsilon_1'$, which in turn depends on $\Delta v_r$; thus some iteration may be required to find a consistent solution.

More detailed ascent simulations from \cite{Stappert2017} predict that the separation velocity for a variety of recovery strategies will be \SIrange{2000}{3300}{\meter\per\second}. For Falcon 9, publicly available data from recent launches shows $v_{ss} = \SIrange{1600}{2100}{\meter\per\second}$ [TODO cite CRS-13 and Iridium 4 webcasts].

The entry maneuver $\Delta v$ will be a fraction of $v_ss$; the value depending on the heating and dynamic pressure which the vehicle can tolerate. Here designers face a trade-off: to reduce the required $\Delta v_e$ the vehicle could be made more robust (e.g. add heat shields or structural reinforcement), or could be provided with small wings to fly a shallow

\subsubsection{Winged stages}
TODO

For recovery strategies in which a lifting-body flies back using air-breathing propulsion, the mass of fuel for the air-breathing engine should be calculated from the Berguet range equation and counted in $m_{rh,1}$. $\Delta v_r$ should be set to zero.

\section{Cost Model}
Next, we attempt to quantify the cost savings from reusing the first stage. The cost savings are quantified by the cost factor $r_c$, which is the ratio of the average cost of one flight of a reusable first stage to the average cost of an expendable first stage. For $r_c < 1$, the reusable system has lower recurring costs. Write $r_c$ in terms of some of the cost elements identified in \cite{Sforza2015}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cost_elements}
r_c = \frac{\frac{C_{pr}}{n} + C_{pn} + C_f + C_{ro}}{C_{pe}}
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the average lifetime number of flights for a reusable first stage. The cost elements of the reusable first stage are: $C_{pr}$, the production cost of the reusable components; $C_{pn}$, the production cost of the new (non-reusable) components; $C_f$, the refurbishment cost; and $C_{ro}$, the recovery operations cost. The expendable stage production cost is $C_{pe}$. Note that this cost model does not capture development costs. Also, $r_c$ only includes those costs directly relevant to the first stage, and excludes other factors which contribute to the launch service cost (upper stage, facilities, and insurance, etc.).

Actual costs vary with booster size scale, are difficult to estimate for new vehicle proposals \cite{Sforza2015}, and are often not publicly available. Instead, it is more helpful to write the cost factor in terms of dimensionless ratios which can be more readily estimated. I define the following ratios:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The recovered cost ratio, $z$, which is the ratio of the cost of the recovered hardware to the total production cost of the recoverable stage
    \begin{equation}
    z = \frac{C_{pr}}{C_{pr} + C_{pn}}
    \end{equation}
    By definition, $z \in [0, 1]$. For full-recovery strategies, $z=1$. For strategies which recover only the engines and other high-value components, $z \approx 0.5$ \cite{Ragab2015} (TODO more general engine cost as fraction of stage cost. I think Atlas V has a unusually expensive engine).
    
    \item The recovery and refurbishment cost ratio, $q$, which is the cost of recovery and refurbishment divided by production cost of the reusable hardware.
    \begin{equation}
    q = \frac{C_{f} + C_{ro}}{C_{pr}}
    \end{equation}
    By definition, $q > 0$. Inefficient recovery strategies can have $q > 1$, in which case recovery cannot lead to cost savings and is probably not worthwhile. In some extreme proposals, the only recovery/refurbishment operation would be to reload the stage with propellant \cite{Musk2017}. In this case, propellant costs give a lower limit of $q \approx 0.01$ for hydrocarbon/oxygen stages \cite{Ragab2015}. A more moderate estimate from \cite{Sforza2015} gives $q \approx 0.25$ (15\% for refurbishment and another 10\% for recovery operations). It should be expected that downrange recovery strategies will incur higher $q$ than launch site recovery, due to the added cost of shipping back the stage. Further, landing directly in the ocean likely increases $q$ due to salt water damage. Practical data on first stage recovery and refurbishment costs is limited. In the Space Shuttle program, SRB recovery and refurbishment almost exceeded production costs ($q \approx 1$) [TODO citation needed]. Refurbishment cost data for Falcon 9 is not publicly available, but SpaceX leadership has stated that the refurbishment cost of the first Falcon 9 booster to be re-used was ``substantially less than half'' of the production cost ($q<0.5$) \cite{Foust2017}.
   
    \item The production cost ratio, $b$, which is the ratio of production costs for reusable and expendable stages.
    \begin{equation}
    b = \frac{C_{pr} + C_{pn}}{C_{pe}}
    \end{equation}
    We should expect that, all other factors being equal, reusable stages will be more expensive to produce, so $b>1$. Several factors increase the cost of reusable stages:
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Extra hardware - Recovery devices (which are not required on an expendable version) add to the production cost. The magnitude of this effect is difficult to estimate in a general manner.
    	\item More durable hardware - More expensive materials or designs may be employed to extend component life. The magnitude of this effect may increase weakly with $n$, but is  difficult to estimate in a general manner.
    	\item Lower production rate - If a reusable and expendable fleet are to provide the same total number of launches \footnote{This may not be a good assumption - if a fleet has significantly lower launch costs, it may be able to capture a larger share of the launch market or increase the volume of the launch market}, the expendable fleet will require $n$ times more first stages. Due to experience curve effects, the average cost of producing a stage is expected to decline as the production volume increases. The average reusable stage production cost would therefore be higher, even if the first-unit costs are identical. If the experience curve is described by a power law with learning rate $s$, then
    	\begin{equation}
    	b = \frac{C_{pr}' n^{-\log_2(s)} + C_{pn}'}{C_{pe}'}
    	\end{equation}
    	where primes denote first-unit costs (as opposed to average costs).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Using these factors, Equation \ref{eq:cost_elements} can be re-written as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:r_c_dimensionless}
r_c = z b \left( \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1 - z}{z} + q \right)
\end{equation}

There is substantial uncertainty and project-to-project variation in the cost ratios $b$ and $q$, so we should not expect to predict a single, general value for $r_c$. However, we can establish some plausible bounds on $r_c$ for the full and partial reuse cases. In the limit of a ``perfectly reusable'' stage ($n\rightarrow\infty, b=1, q=0$), Equation \ref{eq:r_c_dimensionless} reduces to $r_c = 1 - z$. This puts a hard lower limit on the cost factor for partial reuse strategies:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:r_c_low_limit}
r_c > 1 - z
\end{equation}

The cost model is further explored in Figure \ref{fig:cost_model}, which shows contours of $r_c$ over a plausible range of $q$ and $b$. Each subplot shows an different scenario for the recovered cost ratio $z$ and the component life $n$. Several interesting factors are apparent. First, partial recovery strategies ($z=0.5$, right column of plots) are more sensitive to changes in the production cost ratio $b$, and are impractical for $b>2$ even with long life and low refurbishment costs. Second, full recovery strategies can offer large 1st stage cost savings (low $r_c$) if the refurbishment costs are kept low and the stages have long lifetimes, even if production costs for reusable stages are relatively high. In a full-recovery strategy, it is likely worthwhile to make design changes which can streamline refurbishment and increase life, even if they increase the production cost.

Impractical regimes where re-use would not reduce cost ($r_c>1$) are shaded grey. The plots in the left column correspond to full recovery strategies ($z=1$), and the right to partial recovery ($z=0.5$). The top row corresponds to a conservative reusable component life ($n=4$ flights), the middle to a moderate life ($n=16$) and the bottom to an optimistic life ($n=64$).}
\end{figure}

To facilitate later comparisons of full vs partial recovery strategies, I compute their cost ratios in two scenarios: one making optimistic assumptions about the other variables in the reuse cost model, and one making more moderate assumptions. Table \ref{tab:cost_scenarios} shows that we can reasonably expect the cost factor to be between $0.05$ and $0.52$ for full recovery, and $0.78$ or more for partial recovery. The moderate-assumption case agrees with other assessments that a fully reusable first stage can reduce launch costs "by a factor of 2 to 3" \cite{Hampsten2010}.

\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\hline
& Optimistic & Moderate \\
& $q=0.02, b=1.5, n=64$ & $q=0.20, b=2.0, n=16$ \\
\hline
Full recovery $z=1$ & 0.05 & 0.53 \\
Partial recovery $z=0.5$ & 0.78 & 1.3 \\

\section{Cost \& Performance Tradeoffs/Comparison}
TODO
The trade a launch operator is willing to make depends on many complicated, context specific factors (cost structure, payload discretization, etc.). Therefore, it is not possible to specify a single strategy as being `best'. Rather, this section seeks to identify the set of Pareto-optimal strategies, each of which offers the greatest payload for a certain level of cost reduction.
