    "# Evaluating and Choosing Flexible Designs\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating and choosing designs in the context of uncertainty is challenging because:\n",
    "  - We must consider the **distribution of the inputs** to avoid succumbing to the flaw of averages (see previous Uncertainty in Design lesson)\n",
    "  - We must consider the **distribution of value** for each project, not merely compare point estimates of the NPV.\n",
    "  - The decision criteria can be complicated, and we face **trade-offs between values which are hard to compare**. Designs may be valued along several dimensions, such as $E[NPV]$, risk, and initial capex. There may also be social value dimensions which are hard to price.\n",
    "  \n",
    "As a result, we will usually not be able to point to a single best solution. Rather, we will have a Pareto set of dominant solutions. Which of the dominant solutions is preferable will be up to the preferences of the stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "de Neufville proposes a 3-step evaluation process:\n",
    "  1. *Evaluation of individual designs* - Build a model of the system, incl. decision rules for exercising flexibility. Run Monte-Carlo simulations on the model to estimate the value distribution.\n",
    "  2. *Multidimensional comparison of designs* - There are various techniques for visualizing and comparing value distributions.\n",
    "  3. *Validation by sensitivity analysis* - Examine the sensitivity of each option's value to various model assumptions. Determine under which assumptions a given choice is  preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 Evaluation of Individual Designs\n",
    " - Use Monte Carlo Simulation to propagate distributions of input to distributions of outputs.\n",
    " - Requires 1000s of model evaluations - we need a model which is computationally simple enough to evaluate quickly.\n",
    " - Model must include decision rules for when to exercise flexibility (i.e. a sub-model of how the project managers will make decisions).\n",
    "  - Result is the estimated cumulative distribution function (CDF) for each option.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Multidimensional Comparison of Designs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Basic Approach: Plot the Net Present Value Distributions\n",
    "Basic approach: plot the NPV CDFs for each option together on the same graph. In some situations, one option dominates the others - its distribution curve lies entirely to the right:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Net present value distributions with dominant option](files/evaluating_and_choosing_flexible_designs_figures/npv_cdf_dominate_2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, often we face a more complicated situation, where the distribution curves cross and there is not a clearly dominant option. In this case, we face a trade-off between risk and expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Net present value distributions with no dominant option](files/evaluating_and_choosing_flexible_designs_figures/npv_cdf_nondom.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Pareto Fronts to Illustrate Trade-offs\n",
    "Illustrate trade-offs between two outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. [[from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization)]:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pareto front example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Front_pareto.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Initial Capital Expenditure (capex)\n",
    "The initial capital expenditure (capex) is another useful dimension on which to compare options, in addition to the NPV. Lower capex is preferable - it will be harder to raise funding/support for options with higher capex. Even if a higher capex option offers a better NPV distribution, project stakeholders may be unwilling to \"spend more to buy the better option\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Difference Curves\n",
    "Straightforward - the \"difference curve\" between options A and B is the CDF of the random variable $(NPV_A - NPV_B)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 \"Upside-Downside\" curves\n",
    "Shows how the dispersion of an output distribution varies against one of the input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Upside-downside curve example](files/evaluating_and_choosing_flexible_designs_figures/upside_downside_curve.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6 Regret curves\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about possible regrets the project team might have in the future. \"If we choose option A, under what circumstances might we wish we had gone with option B instead?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The regret plot is a scatter plot which compares the performance of two options in each of the scenarios generated in the Monte Carlo simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![regret plot regions](files/evaluating_and_choosing_flexible_designs_figures/regret_plot_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The regret plot is cool because unlike the other options, it can show correlations between the value of A and the value of B. The other plots only show the \"marginal\" (?) cdf of A, regardless of how B performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is my best guess at how to interpret various patterns on the regret plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "![regret plot patterns](files/evaluating_and_choosing_flexible_designs_figures/regret_plot_2.png)\n",
    "^ I'm not sure if this is right, let's discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe scatter-plotting $NPV_A$ vs $NPV_B$ would be more intuitive? Let's discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, no meaningful results for \"regret plots\". While regret is used as a term in decision theory ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regret_(decision_theory))), the \"regret plot seems to be something de Neufville made up, not a generally accepted technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.7 Later Capital Expenditures\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be interesting to see distributions of when in time flexibility is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "de Neufville is rather light on how to do this in this chapter ... I've found a few other books which may be more helpful. See also \"Tornado Plots\" in the Monte Carlo\n",
