    "# TRANSCOST Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The TRANSCOST model is a vehicle dedicated-dedicated system model for determining the cost per flight (CpF) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) for launch vehicle systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Three key cost areas make up the model:\n",
    "1. Development Cost\n",
    "1. Production Cost\n",
    "1. Operations Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these cost areas and strategies for modeling them will be reviewed before combining them to model the CpF.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "The Development Costs model can be separated into the following categories:\n",
    "1. Systems Engineering ($f_0$)\n",
    "1. Strap-on Boosters ($B$)\n",
    "1. Vehicle Systems/Stages ($V$)\n",
    "1. Engines ($E$)\n",
    "\n",
    "These elements are combined into the following equation which gives the total development cost for a launch vehicle:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C_D = f_0 \\left( \\sum{H_B} + \\sum{H_V} + \\sum{H_E} \\right) f_6\\ f_7\\ f_8\\ \\left[PYr \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to discuss the units of this equation: the Person-Year [PYr]. The Person-Year unit is a cost unit which is independent of inflation or changing currency exchange rates. The value of the Person-Year is determined by the total cost of maintaining an employee for a year, which includes direct wages, travel costs, office costs, and other indirect costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now go over each term in this expression to clarify its meaning and how to determine its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_0$: systems engineering/integration factor. When developing and producing launch vehicles, multiple stages and vehicle systems need to be integrated together. The integration of the multiple system elements imparts an increase to the development cost, which is captured by this term. This term can be calculated using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_0 = 1.04^N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of stages or major system elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_6$: cost growth factor for deviating from the optimum schedule. There is an optimum schedule for development and providing funding for any particular project. Deviations from this optimal schedule impart a penalty on the development cost. Historically, launch vehicles take between 5 and 9 years to develop. Working faster or slower than the optimum schedule will result in cost increases however. The instance of $f_6 = 1.0$ represents development that follows the ideal schedule perfectly. This will almost certainly never be the case, and typical values for $f_6$ range between 1.0 and 1.5. \n",
    "\n",
    "$f_7$: cost growth factor for parallel organizations. In order to have efficient delegation of tasks and conflict resolution, a prime contractor needs to be established. Having multiple co-prime contractors leads to many inefficiencies, which imparts a penalty on the development cost. This factor can be calculated using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_7 = n^{0.2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of parallel prime contractors. Having multiple contractors on a project imparts no penalty as long as they are organized in a prime contractor/subcontractor relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "$f_8$: person-year correction factor for productivity differences in different countries/regions. Productivity differences exist between different countries and regions, so this must be accounted for in the model. This factor is baselined for productivity in the United States, so for the US $f_8 = 1.0$. Some other countries of interest include Russia with $f_8 = 2.11$, China with $f_8 = 1.34$, Europe (ESA) with $f_8 = 0.86$, and France/Germany with $f_8 = 0.77$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost Exponential Relationships (CERs)\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the development cost of each major vehicle element, denoted as $H$ in the above total development cost equation, we introduce a series of cost exponential relationships (CER). These CERs relate the reference mass of a stage or system element to its development cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "CERs have been definied for the following vehicle elements:\n",
    "1. Solid-propellant Rocket Motors\n",
    "1. Liquid-propellant Rocket Engines with Turbopumps\n",
    "1. Pressure-fed Rocket Engines\n",
    "1. Airbreathing Turbo- and Ramjet-Engines\n",
    "1. Large Solid-Propellant Rocket Boosters\n",
    "1. Liquid Propellant Propulsion Systems/Modules\n",
    "1. Expendable Ballistic Stages and Transfer Vehicles\n",
    "1. Reusable Ballistic Launch Vehicles\n",
    "1. Winged Orbital Rocket Vehicles\n",
    "1. Horizontal Take-off First Stage Vehicles, Advanced Aircraft, and Aerospaceplanes\n",
    "1. Vertical Take-off First Stage-Fly-back Rocket Vehicles\n",
    "1. Crewed Ballistic Re-entry Capsules\n",
    "1. Crewed Space Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form for these CERs are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = a\\ M^x\\ f_1\\ f_2\\ f_3\\ f_8 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, $a$ and $x$ are empirically determined coefficients for a particular type of vehicle stage or system. \n",
    "\n",
    "$M$: reference mass (dry mass), in kilograms, of the vehicle system, stage, or engine being considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_1$: development standard factor. This factor accounts for the relative status of the project in comparison to the state of the art or other existing projects. The development of a standard project that has similar systems already in operation would have $f_1 = 0.9 - 1.1$. The development of a project that is a minor variation on an existing product would have $f_1 = 0.4 - 0.6$. The development of a first-generation system would have $f_1 = 1.3 - 1.4$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$f_3$: team experience factor. This factor accounts for the relavant experience of the team working on the development of a new project. An industry team with some related experience would have $f_3 = 1.0$. A very experienced team who has worked on similar projects previously would have $f_3 = 0.7 - 0.8$. A new team with little or no previous experience would have $f_3 = 1.3 - 1.4$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$f_2$: technical quality factor. This factor is not as well-defined as the other cost factors. Its value is derived from technical characterists of a particular vehicle element, and is defined uniquely for each vehicle element. Often, the fit of the CER is good enough without this factor, and so in those cases $f_2 = 1.0$. For others though, a particular relationship is derived for it. For instance, for the development of a liquid turbo-fed engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_2 = 0.026 \\left(\\ln{N_Q}\\right)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N_Q$ is the number of qualification firings for the engine. This indicates that development cost increases as the number of test firings increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example - Calculating Development Cost for SSMEs\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will consider an example to clarify the above model. We will look at the development costs of the Space Shuttle Main Engines. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we find the appropriate CER for modeling this. The CER for liquid turbo-fed engines is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = 277\\ M^{0.48}\\ f_1\\ f_2\\ f_3 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The development standard factor, $f_1$ can be taken to by 1.3 since this is a \"first of its kind\" project. The team experience factor, $f_3$, can be taken as 0.85 since a lot of the team had worked on the F-1 and J-2 engines at Rocketdyne. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the technical quality factor, $f_2$, using the equation for turbo-fed liquid engines described in the previous section, knowing that the SSMEs required roughly 900 test firings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the SSME dry mass is 3180 kg.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then calculate the total development cost as follows:\n"
