    "# TRANSCOST Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The TRANSCOST model is a vehicle dedicated-dedicated system model for determining the cost per flight (CpF) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) for launch vehicle systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Three key cost areas make up the model:\n",
    "1. Development Cost\n",
    "1. Production Cost\n",
    "1. Operations Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these cost areas and strategies for modeling them will be reviewed before combining them to model the CpF.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "The Development Costs model can be separated into the following categories:\n",
    "1. Systems Engineering ($f_0$)\n",
    "1. Strap-on Boosters ($B$)\n",
    "1. Vehicle Systems/Stages ($V$)\n",
    "1. Engines ($E$)\n",
    "\n",
    "These elements are combined into the following equation which gives the total development cost for a launch vehicle:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C_D = f_0 \\left( \\sum{H_B} + \\sum{H_V} + \\sum{H_E} \\right) f_6\\ f_7\\ f_8\\ \\left[PYr \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to discuss the units of this equation: the Person-Year [PYr]. The Person-Year unit is a cost unit which is independent of inflation or changing currency exchange rates. The value of the Person-Year is determined by the total cost of maintaining an employee for a year, which includes direct wages, travel costs, office costs, and other indirect costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now go over each term in this expression to clarify its meaning and how to determine its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_0$: systems engineering/integration factor. When developing and producing launch vehicles, multiple stages and vehicle systems need to be integrated together. The integration of the multiple system elements imparts an increase to the development cost, which is captured by this term. This term can be calculated using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_0 = 1.04^N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of stages or major system elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_6$: cost growth factor for deviating from the optimum schedule. There is an optimum schedule for development and providing funding for any particular project. Deviations from this optimal schedule impart a penalty on the development cost. Historically, launch vehicles take between 5 and 9 years to develop. Working faster or slower than the optimum schedule will result in cost increases however. The instance of $f_6 = 1.0$ represents development that follows the ideal schedule perfectly. This will almost certainly never be the case, and typical values for $f_6$ range between 1.0 and 1.5. \n",
    "\n",
    "$f_7$: cost growth factor for parallel organizations. In order to have efficient delegation of tasks and conflict resolution, a prime contractor needs to be established. Having multiple co-prime contractors leads to many inefficiencies, which imparts a penalty on the development cost. This factor can be calculated using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_7 = n^{0.2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of parallel prime contractors. Having multiple contractors on a project imparts no penalty as long as they are organized in a prime contractor/subcontractor relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "$f_8$: person-year correction factor for productivity differences in different countries/regions. Productivity differences exist between different countries and regions, so this must be accounted for in the model. This factor is baselined for productivity in the United States, so for the US $f_8 = 1.0$. Some other countries of interest include Russia with $f_8 = 2.11$, China with $f_8 = 1.34$, Europe (ESA) with $f_8 = 0.86$, and France/Germany with $f_8 = 0.77$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost Exponential Relationships (CERs)\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the development cost of each major vehicle element, denoted as $H$ in the above total development cost equation, we introduce a series of cost exponential relationships (CER). These CERs relate the reference mass of a stage or system element to its development cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "CERs have been definied for the following vehicle elements:\n",
    "1. Solid-propellant Rocket Motors\n",
    "1. Liquid-propellant Rocket Engines with Turbopumps\n",
    "1. Pressure-fed Rocket Engines\n",
    "1. Airbreathing Turbo- and Ramjet-Engines\n",
    "1. Large Solid-Propellant Rocket Boosters\n",
    "1. Liquid Propellant Propulsion Systems/Modules\n",
    "1. Expendable Ballistic Stages and Transfer Vehicles\n",
    "1. Reusable Ballistic Launch Vehicles\n",
    "1. Winged Orbital Rocket Vehicles\n",
    "1. Horizontal Take-off First Stage Vehicles, Advanced Aircraft, and Aerospaceplanes\n",
    "1. Vertical Take-off First Stage-Fly-back Rocket Vehicles\n",
    "1. Crewed Ballistic Re-entry Capsules\n",
    "1. Crewed Space Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form for these CERs are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = a\\ M^x\\ f_1\\ f_2\\ f_3\\ f_8 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, $a$ and $x$ are empirically determined coefficients for a particular type of vehicle stage or system. \n",
    "\n",
    "$M$: reference mass (dry mass), in kilograms, of the vehicle system, stage, or engine being considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_1$: development standard factor. This factor accounts for the relative status of the project in comparison to the state of the art or other existing projects. The development of a standard project that has similar systems already in operation would have $f_1 = 0.9 - 1.1$. The development of a project that is a minor variation on an existing product would have $f_1 = 0.4 - 0.6$. The development of a first-generation system would have $f_1 = 1.3 - 1.4$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$f_3$: team experience factor. This factor accounts for the relavant experience of the team working on the development of a new project. An industry team with some related experience would have $f_3 = 1.0$. A very experienced team who has worked on similar projects previously would have $f_3 = 0.7 - 0.8$. A new team with little or no previous experience would have $f_3 = 1.3 - 1.4$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$f_2$: technical quality factor. This factor is not as well-defined as the other cost factors. Its value is derived from technical characterists of a particular vehicle element, and is defined uniquely for each vehicle element. Often, the fit of the CER is good enough without this factor, and so in those cases $f_2 = 1.0$. For others though, a particular relationship is derived for it. For instance, for the development of a liquid turbo-fed engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_2 = 0.026 \\left(\\ln{N_Q}\\right)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N_Q$ is the number of qualification firings for the engine. This indicates that development cost increases as the number of test firings increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example - Calculating Development Cost for SSMEs\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will consider an example to clarify the above model. We will look at the development costs of the Space Shuttle Main Engines. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we find the appropriate CER for modeling this. The CER for liquid turbo-fed engines is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = 277\\ M^{0.48}\\ f_1\\ f_2\\ f_3 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The development standard factor, $f_1$ can be taken to by 1.3 since this is a \"first of its kind\" project. The team experience factor, $f_3$, can be taken as 0.85 since a lot of the team had worked on the F-1 and J-2 engines at Rocketdyne. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the technical quality factor, $f_2$, using the equation for turbo-fed liquid engines described in the previous section, knowing that the SSMEs required roughly 900 test firings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the SSME dry mass is 3180 kg.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then calculate the total development cost as follows:\n"

    "\n",
    "Modeling the operations cost is much more difficult than modeling the development and production cost due to a large amount of operational influences, as well as scarce reliable reference data. That being said, we will try to model it best as possible.\n",

    "1. Indirect Operations Cost (IOC)\n",
    "1. Refurbishment and Spares Cost (RSC) \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that all payload-related activities are exluded from this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of ELVs, operations costs make up around 20-35% of the total Cost per Flight (CpF). In the case of RLVs, the operations costs typically make up 35-70% of the total CpF. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct Operations Cost (DOC)\n",
    "\n",
    "The direct operations cost accounts for all activities directly related to the ground preparations of a launch vehicle, plus launch operations and checkout.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five cost areas that make up the DOC:\n",
    "1. Ground Operations\n",
    "1. Materials and Propellants\n",
    "1. Flight and Mission Operations\n",
    "1. Transportation and Recovery\n",
    "1. Fees and Insurance\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these cost areas are easier to estimate than others. We will go over strategies for estimating each of these cost areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ground Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Many things affect the cost of the ground operations, including: the size and complexity of the vhicle; the fact of a crewed or automated vehicle; the assembly, mating, and transportation mode of the vehicle (vertical or horizontal); the launch mode and associated launch facilities; and the number of launches per year. \n",
    "\n",
    "The followoing provisional CER can be used to estimate the pre-launch ground operations cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C_{PLO} = 8\\ {M_0}^{0.67}\\ L^{-0.9}\\ N^{0.7}\\ f_V\\ f_C\\ f_4\\ f_8 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$M_0$: gross weight at lift-off (GLOW) of the vehicle in Mg (metric tons)\n",
    "\n",
    "$L$: launch rate given as launches per year (LpA). This factor and the exponent of -0.9 defines how the required team size grows with launch rate. If the exponent of L was -1.0, this would mean a constant team size regardless of launch rate, which is unrealistic. As a side note, an important consideration with RLVs for determing the LpA (and the fleet size) is the necessary turn-around time for the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "$N$: number of stages or major vehicle elements. This represents how more operational effort is required with more systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "$f_v$: launch vehicle type factor. This factor accounts for the varying operational effort required for different launch vehicle types. \n",
    "\n",
    "For expendable multistage vehicles:\n",
    " - liquid-propellant vehicles with cryogenic propellant: $f_v = 1.0$\n",
    " - liquid-propellant vehicles with storable propellant: $f_v = 0.8$\n",
    " - solid-propellant vehicles: $f_v = 0.3$\n",

    "$f_c$: assembly and integration mode factor. This accounts for the difference in operational effort required for different assembly and checkout modes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Vertical assembly and checkout on the launch pad: $f_c = 1.0$\n",
    " - Vertical assembly and checkout, then transport to launch pad: $f_c = 0.7$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Costs of Propellants and Gases\n",
    "\n",
    "Propellants represent a relatively small fraction of the total CpF. Propellant costs are highly dependent on the production source capacity, as well as the country/region of purchase (for instance, LH2 costs nearly twice as much in Europe as it does in the US). \n",
    "\n",
    "For liquid propellants, it is important to consider the mass of propellant that will be boiled off during filling, as well as the actual mass required to fill the tanks. For LOX, 50-70% additional propellant is required (beyond what is needed to fill the tanks) to account for boil-off. For LH2, 75-95% additional propellant is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the cost of solid-propellants is included in the production cost and not the operations cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Launch, Flight and Mission Operations Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "This cost area includes:\n",
    " - Mission planning and preparation, including software update\n",
    " - Launch and ascent flight control until payload separation\n",
    " - Orbital and return flight operations in the ase of reusable launch systems\n",
    " - Flight safety control and tracking\n",
    " \n",
    "This cost area does NOT include crew operations or in-orbit experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ELVs, the launch, flight and mission operations cost is relatively minimal given the short flight-time. For RLVs, this cost is much higher due to extended mission times and increased complexity.\n",

    "For unmanned systems, the following provisional CER has been determined for the per-flight cost:\n",

    " - Recoverable or fly-back systems: $Q_N = 1.0$ each.\n",
    " - Unmanned reusable orbital systems: $Q_N = 2.0$ each.\n",
    " - Crewed orbital vehicles: $Q_N = 3.0$ each.\n",
    " \n",
    "For example, we can consider the launch of the ATHENA Vehicle from Wallops Island. We will consider it in two cases:\n",
    "1. Early Operations: 10th flight, 5 launches per year\n",
    "1. Mature Operations: 50th flight, 8 launches per year\n",

    "From the example of the shuttle, it can be seen that the majority of the launch, flight, and missions operations cost comes from having a crewed system, rather than an automated system. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ground Transportation and Recovery Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "This cost area includes things such as transportation of vehicle elements from their fabrication site to the launch area, transportation of reuable vehicles from a remote landing site to the launch area, and transporation of sea-launch facilities from the home harbour to the launch location and back. \n",
    "\n",
    "Transportation costs for moving elements from their fabrication site to the launch area and cost of transporting sea-launch facilities cannot be accurately estimated with a CER.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a preliminary CER for the recovery cost for stages or boosters at sea is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C_{Rec} = \\frac{1.5}{L}\\left({7\\ L^{0.7} + M^{0.83}}\\right)\\ f_8\\ [PYr] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$L$ is the launch rate, $M$ is the recovery mass in Mg (metric tons), and $f_8$ is the person-year correction factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific cost per recovery decreases with launch rate and increases with recovery mass, which makes intuitive sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fees and Insurance Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of fees and insurance costs contribute to the CpF for launch vehicles. Some of these fees include:\n",
    "1. **Launch site user fee.** For most US launch sites, the US Department of Transportation (DOT) charges a per-launch fee. It should be noted that the DOC only considers the per-launch fee of using a launch site, and doesn't account for a yearly fixed general fee for using a launch site, which would be handled as part of the IOC. \n",
    "1. **Public damage insurance.** Most governments require launch service providers to take an insruance against damage caused by parts of a launch vehicle falling to the groung. \n",
    "1. **Launch vehicle insurance.** For ELVs, the insurance for a launch failure and payload loss normally has to be payed by the customer separately. For RLVs, the launch service provider is the owner of the vehicle and must insure its lifetime. However, the catastrophic failure rate for RLVs can be substantially reduced in comparison to ELVs due to increase redundancy, integrated health control systems, landing capabilities in case of emergencies, and the ability to perform flight tests. \n",
    "1. **Surcharge for mission abort.** In the case of RLVs, there is a possibility that the vehicle performs an emergency landing without deploying or delivering the payload. In this case, the launch service provider would likely be obligated to provide a free re-launch to the customer. The cost of this mission abort must be considered by the launch provider. A mission abort could be more expensive than the rest of the DOC given necessary investigations that would follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refurbishment and Spares Cost (RSC)\n",
    "\n",
    "This cost area accounts for the cost or refurbishment and maintenance of launch vehicles. It is important to distinguish the difference between the terms refurbishment and maintenance. Here, refurbishment refers to off-line activities, or major vehicle overhauls that have to be performed only after a certain number of flights. On the other hand, maintenance refers to on-line activities and includes everything that has to be done between two consecutive flights. Maintenance is accounted for in the pre-launch ground oeprations cost, and is not handled as part of the RSC. \n",
    "\n",
    "Major refurbishment activities include:\n",
    "1. Detailed vehicle system inspection (especially structure, tanks, and thermal protection)\n",
    "1. Exchange of critical structure elements, such as TPS panels\n",
    "1. Replacement of the complete main rocket engines\n",
    "1. Exchange of critical components of the pressurization and feed system, power and electric system, and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "The refurbishment costs for a vehicle element are typically treated as a percentage of the element production cost. The total refurbishment cost over the vehicle's lifetime must be distributed over the total number of flights to find the impact on the CpF. Like in calculating the development and production costs, engines and vehicle stages are handled separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vehicle System Refurbishment Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "The costs of the refurbishment and spares' cost per flight for various air- and space-craft are given in the chart below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![RSC](transcost_figures/rsc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to note that the refurbishment cost and vehicle lifetime are NOT independent. The average per-flight refurbishment effort will increase with an increasing number of lifetime fights, since a larger number of vehicle elements will need to be exchanged. With this in mind, there may be an optimum number of vehicle reflights, beyond which it is more cost-effective to introduce a new vehicle than continue reusing an existing one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rocket Engine Refurbishment Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "There is very little data available to quantify the engine refurbishment cost. Data for the SSMEs however amounts to a per-flight refurbishment cost of 11% of the original production cost. For future RLVs with a self-diagnosis system that will indicate maintenance requirements, refurbishment effot can be expected to reduce to below 0.5% per flight, with refurbishment every 20 to 25 flights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Engine lifetime is heavily influenced by pressure levels involved. An effective strategy is to operate engines at approximately 90% of design thrust, which substantially lowers refurbishment effort and would potentially decrease the CpF, despite the penalty for operating at a lower thrust.\n",
    "\n",
    "For solid rocket motors, cases can only be reused a few times due to relatively expensive recovery operations. In most scenarios, the cost-effectiveness of reusing solid rocket motors is questionable. In the case of the shuttle SRBs, the recovery and refurbishment effort for the two SRBs was more expensive than a pair of expendable SRBs without the recovery equipment would have been.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indirect Operations Cost (IOC)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Indirect Operations Cost consists of all costs that represent a constant value per year, essentially independent of vehicle size and launch rate. This includes program administration and management, marketing and customer relations, general fees and texes, tehnical support activities, and pilot training, among other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three general cost elements make up the IOC:\n",
    "1. Program Administration and System Management\n",
    "1. Technical Support\n",
    "1. Launch Site Support and Maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "The IOC typically adds up to a fixed cost budget per year, which must ben be divided by the number of launches per year to find its contribution to the CpF. For approximately 6 - 12 LpA, the IOC typically represents 8 - 15% of the CpF. For low launch rate, however, its contribution to the CpF can be much larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program Administration and System Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The only practical way of the assessing the cost of this area is to estimate a number of staff required for these tasks. The staff has to cover a variety of tasks, including marketing and customer relations, vehicle procurement, contracts handling, and accounting. The related general overhead for the staff and these tasks, including rental charges, travel costs, computer power, exhibit and publication costs, and others must be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "Costs of government fees, taxes, insurance costs, and financing costs also need to be considered here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Launch service providers need to provide technical support capabilities for ground operations, including:\n",
    "1. Supervision of technical standard and vehicle performance\n",
    "1. Supervision of industrial contracts for vehicle procurement\n",
    "1. Failure analysis and implementation of techncial changes\n",
    "1. Spares storage and administration (not belonging to refurbishment cost)\n",
    "1. Pilots training and support for piloted vehicles\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easiest to estimate these costs by estimating the number of staff required.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Launch Site Support and Maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "Launch sites operated by governmental organizations operate under a special budget, so launches of national spacecraft are therefore not charged with a launch site support and maintenance cost. For commercial endeavours, however, launch service providers typically have to pay a fixed fee per month or per year for use of the launch infrastructure, in addition to other per-launch fees (which are part of the DOC). This fee is entirely dependent on the specific launch site's fee schedule.\n",
