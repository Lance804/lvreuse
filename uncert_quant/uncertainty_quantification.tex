\section{Performance-Related Uncertainties}

\subsection{Technology Uncertainties}
Uncertainties on the performance factors which we choose to group as the "technology choice": i.e. the specific impulse and inert mass fractions of each stage $c_1, c_2, E_1, E_2$.

Note this is not uncertainty about what the technology choice is - we assume that is given. Rather, given a technology choice (e.g. kerosene fuel, gas generator engine cycle, and aluminum alloy tanks), what is the remaining uncertainty in Isp and inert mass fraction?

\subsubsection{Specific Impulse}
The specific impulse is largely determined by the choice of propellant and engine cycle. However, there are still variations in nominal specific impulse between different engines using the same propellant and cycle and variations away from the nominal specific impulse in the operation of a given engine. These variations contribute to uncertainty in the performance of a new launch vehicle design.

We divide the sources of variation in specific impulse into two categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{variation in nominal $I_{sp}$} -  This captures variations in nominal specific impulse between different engines using the same propellant and cycle. Contributing factors (which may be uncertain at the outset of an engine development project) include chamber pressure, mixture ratio, expansion ratio, and injector $c^*$ efficiency.
    \item \emph{variation in operation} -  This captures variations away from the nominal specific impulse in the operation of a given engine. Contributing factors which may vary between missions include throttling, mixture ratio control, and ambient pressure on different possible trajectories.
\end{itemize}

Uncertainty in nominal $I_{sp}$ only exists if a new engine will be developed for the launch vehicle, or if the engine selection is yet to be made. For a particular launch vehicle, the nominal specific impulse is known once an engine is selected or developed. However, we wish our performance predictions to be representative of the population of engines using a particular technology, and thus include the variation in nominal specific impulse as an uncertainty in the model. TODO.

We model the variation in nominal $I_{sp}$ by examining a sample of existing and historical launch vehicle engines (see Table \ref{tab:engine_historical_trends}; we believe that this is a comprehensive sample of all hydrogen and kerosene engines used for space launch). First, we must determine whether there are historical trends in the performance data. If there were a strong historical trend towards improving performance, then a sample of historical engines would not be representative of the performance in modern and near-future engines. However, liquid propulsion has been a mature field for some time \cite{hist_lpre}, and Figure \ref{fig:engine_historical_trends} shows no clear correlation between performance and year of first flight after 1975. Thus these engines are likely representative of the performance of contemporary and near-future engines.

\end{table}

Next, we need to quantify the uncertainty due to variation in operation. The listed specific impulse values are typically measured at design conditions; we expect that off-design operation could lower these values by 2\%. For \nth{2} (upper) stage engines, which operate in near vacuum, this is the end of the story. For booster engines, there is also a large variation in specific impulse due the effects of altitude. Our performance model requires $c_1$ to be the \emph{effective} \nth{1} stage specific impulse, averaged over the altitudes at which an engine operates. As a crude estimate, we will assume that the effective specific impulse is the mean of the sea level and vacuum values:

\[
    c_1 \approx g_0 \left( \frac{I_{sp, vac} + I_{sp, SL}}{2} \right)
\]

This crude estimate results in surprisingly descent performance predictions \cite{Alber2012}. 

Our performance model needs distributions on $c_1$ and $c_2$, which represent the possible variation in those parameters for a given technology choice. We arbitrarily choose to use triangular distributions, which are commonly used as a rough guess description when limited sample data is available. We will choose the parameters of the distributions based on the historical engine data. We fit a different distribution for each choice of propellant and engine cycle.

For upper stage engines, the distribution parameters are:
\[
 min = 0.98 g_0 \min_{e \in S}(I_{sp, vac}^{e})
\]
\[
 max = g_0 \max_{e \in S}(I_{sp, vac}^{e})
\]
\[
 mode = g_0 \mean_{e \in S}(I_{sp, vac}^{e})
\]

where $S$ is the set of historical engines matching the given propellant and cycle, and $e$ is an engine from that set.

For booster engines, the mean of the vacuum and sea level $I_{sp}$ is used, and the bounds of the distribution are spread by an additional 3\% to account for the crudity of this estimate:
\[
 min = 0.95 g_0 \min_{e \in S}\left( \frac{I_{sp, vac}^e + I_{sp, SL}^e}{2} \right)
\]
\[
 max = 1.03 g_0 \max_{e \in S}\left( \frac{I_{sp, vac}^e + I_{sp, SL}^e}{2} \right)
\]
\[
 mode = g_0 \mean_{e \in S}\left( \frac{I_{sp, vac}^e + I_{sp, SL}^e}{2} \right)
\]

\subsubsection{Inert mass fraction - expendable baseline}
The inert mass fraction expendable baselines, $E_1, E_2$, represent the lower limit of achievable inert mass fraction for a particular technology choice.
The values of $E_1, E_2$ are uncertain and hard to predict from first principles, as they result from a complicated engineering process. However, we can make an informed guess as to what is possible by examining historical trends in launch vehicle stages.

We compiled a sample of historical and active stages which have been sucessfully used in space launch vehicles; the data is drawn mainly from \cite{Isakowitz2004}. We segregate the data into boosters (first stages) and upper stages, as these have different structural design requirements. The present analysis only considers sequentially-staged launch vehciles, so we exclude boosters which cannot lift off under their own thrust.

 First, we must determine whether there are historical trends in the inert mass fraction data. If there were a strong historical trend towards improving inert mass fraction, then a sample of historical stages would not be representative of the performance in modern and near-future stages. Examining Figure \ref{fig:stage_historical_trends}:
 \begin{itemize}
    \item For hydrogen upper stages there is no clear historical trend.
    \item For kerosene upper stages inert mass fraction has declined with time.
    \item For hygrogen boosters, there is only one example capable of liftoff under its own thrust (Delta IV Common Booster Core), so no historical trends can be observed.
    \item For kerosene boosters, there is no clear historical trend.
\end{itemize}

    \caption{\label{fig:stage_historical_trends} Historical trends in stage inert mass. There are no clear trends with time, excepting the declining inert mass fraction of kerosene/\ce{O2} upper stages.}
\end{figure}

Next, we consider the relation between stage inert mass fraction and gross mass. There is reason to suspect that larger stages will have lower $E$, as some inert components (e.g. flight computer) have similar mass regarless of vehicle size. However, in Figure \ref{fig:stage_gross_vs_inert_mass}, we see that while there is a wider spread of inert mass fraction at low gross mass, the acheived \emph{lower limit} of inert mass fraction does not show a clear sensitivity to gross mass.

\end{figure}

The propellant technology choice has a noticeable effect on the inert mass fraction. \ce{H2}/\ce{O2} stages tend to have higher inert mass fraction than kerosene/\ce{O2} stages [Figure \ref{fig:stage_inert_mass_fuel}]. The lower denisty of hydrogen fuel requires larger tanks, increasing the ratio of tank mass to propellant mass.

Other technology choices (e.g. whether to have common or separate bulkheads between the fuel and oxidizer tanks) also effect the inert mass fraction. However, this study will not consider such detailed design choices.
